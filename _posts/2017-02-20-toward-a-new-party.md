The 2016 election raised many questions about how socialists and leftists should approach electoral politics. The Bernie Sanders campaign offered hope, but Hillary Clinton's ultimate primary victory and general election defeat show just how far we have to go. Can we actually pull the Democrats to the left? Is it possible to create a viable third party? Will the working class ever have a party that represents them?

Inspired by Seth Ackerman's article for Jacobin, "[A Blueprint for a New Party](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/bernie-sanders-democratic-labor-party-ackerman/)," we're bringing three North Carolina activists and organizers together to debate the opportunities and roadblocks to building a truly progressive, working class party in the age of Trump.

Panelists include:

* Jillian Johnson: Durham City Council Member and Founding Member, [Durham for All](http://www.durhamforall.org/)
* Lamont Lilly: Vice Presidential Candidate, [Workers World Party](http://www.workers.org/)
* Tony Ndege: Co-chair, [North Carolina Green Party](https://ncgreenparty.nationbuilder.com/)

Moderated by Jedediah Purdy: Professor, [Duke University Law School](https://law.duke.edu/), and Contributing Editor, [Dissent](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/).

The event is free and open to all, but space is limited. We are organizing child care for the event: if you would like to utilize that option, please email [info@dsanc.org](mailto:info@dsanc.org) so we can ensure we have the necessary resources.
